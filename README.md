## Description
This is a fictional site for streaming indie films on a site called Square Eyes. I made this project throughout the Design, HTML, CSS and JavaScript course, and therefore it’s my first Cross Course Project at the front-end-developer program at Noroff Fagskole. The website contains of 11 HTML-pages and I have used Netlify for hosting the site. 
The aim for this project was to show my skills in:
- Design
- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Wordpress REST API 

*Built With*
* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript
* WordPress REST API

### API
I have used the WordPress Rest API in a headless mode to fetch the film sites. I have used one.com to host the WordPress API.
